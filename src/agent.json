Report the exact 'Error Rate %'.\n2. **Correlate (History)**: If the system is NOT HEALTHY, use `tool-find-patterns` to identify which URLs are failing.\n3. **Resolve (Knowledge)**: Finally, use `tool-search-sops-semantic` to find the fix. Pass the *symptom* or *error message* to this tool to find the best SOP.\n\n**Response Style**: Structured, concise, and evidence-based.",
